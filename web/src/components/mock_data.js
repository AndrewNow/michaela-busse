            "Michaela Büsse is a postdoctoral researcher at the chair of Digital Cultures at Technische Universität Dresden and Associated Investigator at the cluster of excellence “Matters of Activity. Image Space Material” at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. In her research she focuses on sociomaterial transformations in the context of speculative urbanism, climate change mitigation, and energy transition. Drawing on elemental anthropology and feminist science and technology studies, she investigates how design practices and technologies govern environments and define who and what is being rendered inhuman.",
            "Michaela received her PhD from University of Art and Design Linz. In the dissertation she analyzes reclamation projects in Southeast Asia and the Netherlands and develops a performative reading of design based on sand’s granular physics. She is currently preparing two new research projects that investigate the role of anticipatory politics in 1) the material transformation of former military sites in the German Democratic Republic and 2) the development of energy hubs in the North Sea in the course of the European Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy. Michaela has previously held positions as Research Associate at Institute of Cultural History and Theory, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Experimental Design and Media Cultures, FHNW, and the Institute for Design Research, ZHdK, as well as fellowships with TU Delft, NTU/Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore, Museum of Contemporary Art and Design Manila, and Strelka Institute for Media, Design and Architecture in Moscow. From 2023-25 she is a fellow at the Research Institute for Sustainability Helmholtz Centre Potsdam.",
            "Michaela’s interdisciplinary practice is research-led and involves filming, editorial and curatorial work. As part of her dissertation project she directed two film works (Building with Nature, Prime Model) and one video installation (White Elephant) that address the recursive relationship between simulation practices and their sites of application, exploring the disjunction between future promises, their material premises, and repercussions. In 2023, and in collaboration with cinematographer Konstantin Mitrokhov and sound artist Andreas Kühne, Michaela produced and directed the sensory-ethnographic film Assembling the Coast.",
            "Michaela is co-founder of Zurich-based OTHERWISE—a collaborative platform that explores the potential of artistic research to contribute to societal and ecological transformations—and has previously been part of the editorial board of the award-winning Migrant Journal—a six-issue publication exploring the circulation of people, goods, information, fauna and flora around the world and the transformative impact they have on space. Together with Emile de Visscher she curated the exhibition Material Legacies (2022/23 Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin) which explored contingencies and ruptures between traditional crafts and the most recent developments at the crossroads of material research, design, engineering, and architecture. In collaboration with Johannes Bruder (Critical Media Lab Basel) and the Dutch collective Hackers & Designers, Michaela developed Cosmogrammatics.xyz, an online repository and experimental publishing platform for notes, documents and visual material collected in studying infrastructural aspects of environmental and energy politics."
